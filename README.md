This is a React application that allows the user to search for the names of players, clubs, and leagues, and receive as a result the Wikipedia Infobox and photo (for players), team tables (for clubs) and league tables (for leagues).
Names have to be searched according to the titles of the Wikipedia page, or else an error message will show up. For instance, instead of just 'Real Madrid' one has to search for 'Real Madrid CF'.
